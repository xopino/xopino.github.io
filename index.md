# About me 

I’m Francesc Madrona, a software engineer based on Reus (Tarragona). My craft lies in transforming complex requirements into robust, scalable software solutions. 

As an advocate of  [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/), I firmly believe in the value of [Agile Processes](http://www.agile-process.org/), I approach software development with a mix of discipline and flexibility, finding immense joy in the art process of making things happen.

In my experience, the true magic unfolds when a team operates as a high-performance unit, where collaboration, innovation, and precision converge.

My coding philosophy —and to life itself— is deeply rooted in principles like [Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), [Domain-Driven Design (DDD)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html), and [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html). These aren't just buzzwords; they are the tools that ensure that what we build is not only resilient but also adaptable —a system that moves gracefully with the ever-changing demands of business.
