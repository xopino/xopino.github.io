# About me 

I am Francesc Madrona, a software engineer based in Reus (Tarragona), with a focus on creating robust and scalable software solutions. With hands-on experience in both startup and corporate environments, I’ve developed a keen understanding of modern software engineering practices and architectural principles.

For the past few years at Freshly, I’ve been instrumental in designing and developing internal products that enhance order processing and e-commerce functionality. I’ve implemented advanced architectural patterns such as Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing to modernize legacy systems, while also integrating complex queue systems like SQS for efficient data handling across multiple platforms.

I have consistently utilized key principles such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Hexagonal Architecture, and SOLID. These concepts are central to my approach, ensuring that the solutions I build are both robust and adaptable to evolving business needs. By focusing on these principles, I create flexible and maintainable systems that can swiftly respond to changes in business requirements.

My role extends to optimizing application performance in PrestaShop and maintaining CI/CD pipelines to ensure smooth deployments. I've also contributed to internal knowledge sharing by developing and managing our company wiki.

Previously, I began my career as an economist, where I utilized statistical programs to perform complex data analysis and financial modeling. This experience sparked my interest in programming, leading me to explore the world of software development. The excitement of creating and maintaining systems quickly captivated me, and I decided to pursue a career in this field. After studying software development and furthering my education I am now fully dedicated to building and optimizing software solutions.
